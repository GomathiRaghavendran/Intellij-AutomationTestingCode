Rule on Master Branch:

	• Venu is going to commit & push all the code from sessions to master branch.
	• Other than Venu, nobody is allowed commit and push the code to master branch.

If anyone above rule by mistake or intentionally.

	•   The person who broke the rule should inform immediately in our main Watsapp group.
	•   The rest of people should not create any pull request from master branch once issue got reported it Watsapp group.
	•   Venu is going to revert the commits which pushed to master branch by mistake,
                     so that master branch will become back to normal with only the code from Venu.



Personal branch:

	•  All the people should have one personal branch from the master branch as a base,
	        and they should the naming standard of the branch like Firstname_Branch

   All the people here other than Venu should clone only personal branch code with below git clone  command

           git clone -b Firstname_Branch git@bitbucket.org:techradarit2023/java_selenium_devops_2023.git

Pull Request to personal branch from master(in Bitbucket)

Be careful with source and destination while creating a pull request, if did a wrong PR & merge your personal branch code to master
    you have to follow the steps defined in master branch rule broke section above

 Everyday once session is done, usually Venu will commit & push all the code to master branch.
 after than you need create a PR(pull request) to your personal branch from master branch & merge it.

	• In this process you might face issues with merge operation if you create some mess in the files from the package called "codeFromVenu" in your personal branch.
	• To unblock the issue with merge in Bitbitbucket, you just need to clone the repo of master somewhere in your computer & copy the package called "codeFromVenu" in your personal branch local repository manually and commit it & push again to your remote personal branch.

 Create one package called "CodeFromFirstName" in your personal local repo & do all the practise in the package only and commit all your practise code
 and push it personal remote branch always.

If you're facing any issues with practise code push, you have report it to Venu in Watsapp and sort it out with Venu on the same day in the end of session.


Common rules:

	• No short-cuts or easy ways until Venu teach about it.
	• No involvements of spouses or IT friends.
	• Always take back up your local repo if you know something was not committed & pushed to remote
	while you are cloning remote repository.


Day to Day activities:

   Create a PR from master to personal branch and merge it
   Clone the personal branch in your computer with below command
       git clone -b Firstname_Branch git@bitbucket.org:techradarit2023/java_selenium_devops_2023.git
  Once you're are done with the practise you need to commit & push regularly.
