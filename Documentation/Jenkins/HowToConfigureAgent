Solution:

It's very easy to configure as Jenkins provide nice library to connect with agents or nodes or VMs easily.

Step 1: Go to manage jenkins > nodes and clouds

Step 2: Create a new node & provide the name of the node(better to keep your slave hostname) and select permanent agent.

Step 3: Give a sweet name to that agent in the field "labels"

Step 4: Give the default location in the field "remote root directory" to run the commands received from jenkins master.

Step 5: Select the launch method as "Launch agent by connecting it to the controller"

Step 6: click on save, after that you will see the agent is created with in dead mode.

Step 7: click on the agent then you will see all the connection details.
