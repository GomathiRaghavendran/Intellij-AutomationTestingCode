The Surefire Plugin will help us to run the test which was written under the test folder of maven project

By default, the Surefire Plugin will automatically include all test classes with the following wildcard patterns:

"**/Test*.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that start with "Test".
"**/*Test.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "Test".
"**/*Tests.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "Tests".
"**/*TestCase.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "TestCase".


Challenge with maven test command:

===================================

I want to run only test suite under the test folder inside mvn project

Solution:

Madam!!!! we have a fantastic solution for it, just use below command:

mvn test -Dtest=testSuiteName

mvn test -Dtest=testSuite1Name,testSuiteName


====================================

I want to run the default testNG.xml & also custom testNG.xml from mvn test command.


Solution:

Madam!!!! We have a super duper solution for you as your are super women.

Firstly, you need to configure the surefire plug to run the default testng.xml available in repository source file in the pom.xml.


    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.1.2</version>
                <configuration>
                    <suiteXmlFiles>
                        <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
                    </suiteXmlFiles>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>


 Second:

 Now you run "mvn test" command in the command prompt, it will run the default testng.xml located in repository source.

 very importantly - if you want to run your customized testng.xml located in different location then use below command

 mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles="pathOftheTestNG.xmlFromRepositorySource"

 "ABOVE COMMAND IS VERY VERY SENSITIVE"


 mvn test -Dbrowser="ff"
