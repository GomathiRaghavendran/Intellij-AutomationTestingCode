Abstraction:

Abstraction means hiding the implementation and showing the functionality.

We can achieve abstraction in java by two ways.

	•  one with Abstract class
	•  another with Interface

We can achieve 0 to 100 per abstraction using abstract class

We can achieve 100 per abstraction using Interface

Abstract class:
	• Abstract class can contains both abstract & non abstract methods.
	• We cannot instantiated abstract class.

Interface:
	•    Interface contains only abstract methods.
	•    We cannot instantiated interface

Implementation of abstract methods will happen in child class.

If you want to extend the Interface, you need use implements keyword instead of extends.


Java 8: static methods are allowed in interface

Importance point to remember in the context of inheritance in interface.

Multiple inheritance is not possible via classes but you can implement multiple interfaces.
