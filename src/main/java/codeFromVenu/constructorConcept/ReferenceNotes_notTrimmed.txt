What is this constructor?

It is similar like a method but constructor name should be same as class name.

There are two type of constructor

		○    Default constructor
		○    Parameterized constructor

Even though if you don't declare any constructor,  your java compiler will define one default constructor & execute it at the time of object creation.


When this constructor will get execution?

It will execute at the time of object creation
