Type Casting?

> The process of storing one datatype of value into another datatype of variable is called type casting in java.

   simple eg:

        storing short datatype value into byte datatype variable


         higher  to lower

         short a1 = 100;
         byte  b1;
         b1 = (byte)a1;

         lower to higher

          byte a1 = 100;
          short  b1;
          b1 = a1;

> Type casting in custom datatype's

      Type casting in custom datatype will occur only when inheritance concept came into picture

      eg: PickPocketer extends ChainSantcher

      Lower to higher

      ChainSnatcher cs = new PickPocketer();

      Higher to lower

      PickPocketer pp = (PickPocketer) new ChainSnatcher();
